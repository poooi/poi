Before your use, here is some information for you!\n\n**poi will never modify your game data, but please use trusted releases and plugins!**\n\npoi does not use proxy by default, and you could change in settings panel:\n\n- If you're using HTTP or Socks5 proxies, make sure it complies to your proxy information;\n- If you're using VPN, simply leave it unset;\n- You may also consider enable Editing DMM Cookie Region Flag setting.\n\nIf you're seeing poi under performance, you may disable some plugins.\n\nIf you prefer alphabetic names to Japanese ones, you may try `Translator` plugin.\n\n---\n\nLike poi?
