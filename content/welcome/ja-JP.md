Good day and welcome to poi {{version}}! Before your use, here is some information for you!

__Poi will never modify your game data, but please use trusted releases and plugins!__

Poi does not use proxy by default, and you could change in settings panel:
- If you're using HTTP or Socks5 proxies, make sure it complies to your proxy information;
- If you're using VPN, simply leave it unset;
- You may also consider enable Editing DMM Cookie Region Flag setting.

If you're seeing poi under performance, you may disable some plugins.

If you prefer alphabetic names to Japanese ones, you may try `Translator` plugin.
